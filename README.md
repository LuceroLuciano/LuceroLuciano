## A little about me:

I'm web developer in training at [Hackwomen.dev](https://hackwomen.dev/) and I'm also student of [Alura LATAM](https://www.aluracursos.com/). Mentor at [Epic Queen](https://epicqueen.com/) in the project [Tecnolochicas PRO](https://tecnolochicas.mx/) where I shared knowledge with girls interested and passionate as I in tecnology and programming. Recently I participated in the Wolk challenge for the Microsoft Partner [Wolk Lab](https://www.wolklab.com/) where I had the opportunity to solve three challenges associated with M365, Azure and Adoption.
